We're a good natured cult.

I mean, we don't keep anyone here by force. Mostly. And the rules make sense. I mean we're not like those weird religious cults. God's OK, but it's Patrick who sets the tone, you know? He's so smart. So powerful.

The thing people notice first is that the menfolk eat first, and the women eat what's left. Doesn't make us sexist. Just that men are bigger is all, and need more calories. Science, you know.

Aw, c'mon. Everyone wants to know about the sex. Don't know why that's the first thing people want to know about. I can tell you it's not weirder than what goes on out in the world. We're just honest about it is all.
