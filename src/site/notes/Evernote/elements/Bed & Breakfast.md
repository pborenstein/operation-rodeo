We used to stay in B&Bs a lot when we were together. 

I remember a place I think it was in Rochester. Or somewhere in Vermont. It must have been during the big family trip. 

I remember the place smelled of mildew. We rolled in late in the night. I think that's when I realized that we could have stayed in an inexpensive hotel. The boy didn't like the place at all. I wonder if I was less empathic then. If I threw the consolation and comfort duties to C.

I wonder what we would have been like if we were still together. But no relationship lasts. All relationships move to a steady state where nothing changes.
