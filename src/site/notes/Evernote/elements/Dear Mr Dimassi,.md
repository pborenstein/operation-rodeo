Dear Mr Dimassi,
I understand from your daughter, Angela, that you have retired. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for your work. But most of all, I wanted to thank you for helping me teach my son, Gil, how to be at home in the world.
Since his mother and I divorced, I've been bringing Gil to Bruno's every few weeks for a haircut. Your staff, and especially you, took an interest in him-- as you do for your regular customers. You greeted him by name, asked him about his school, his summer plans, and so on. To you, this is just part of the job. To me, it was priceless.
Gil has Aspergers, a kind of autism, so the experience he had in your shop and the things he learned, are invaluable.
You helped Gil understand that he is part of a larger community. That we take turns. That people outside his school, family, and friends know him.
The sign over the door may say "Bruno's", but to me and Gil it will always be "Italo's".
Thank you for everything. May your retirement be long and restful. Buona fortuna!
